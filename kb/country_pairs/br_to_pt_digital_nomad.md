- Minimum income proof is typically pegged to Portuguese minimum wage (4x monthly); include remote work contracts and payment history.
- Apostilled FBI/Polícia Federal background checks are expected; schedule early due to processing time.

- NIF and Portuguese bank account help but are not strictly required at filing; include if available.
