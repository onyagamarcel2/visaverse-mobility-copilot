# Working Holiday Essentials: Philippines → Australia

## Timeline highlights
- **Month 0-1:** Secure certificate of employment, bank statements covering the last 3 months, and proof of booked return ticket (or funds to purchase one).
- **Month 1-2:** Schedule a biometrics appointment at VFS, complete the online WHV form (Subclass 417), and pay the AU$635 fee.
- **Month 2+:** Undergo panel physician medicals if prompted, wait for grant letter (average 6–8 weeks), then link the visa to your ImmiAccount prior to departure.

## Priority documents
- Passport valid 6+ months beyond intended stay with at least two blank visa pages.
- Certified proof of funds (minimum AU$5,000 equivalent) plus onward travel evidence.
- NBI clearance and health insurance covering your first six months in Australia.

## Tips & risks
- Immigration may request updated bank statements if processing exceeds 8 weeks—monitor accounts weekly.
- WHV holders cannot stay more than 6 months with one employer; line up multiple job leads before departure.
- Book biometrics early in Cebu/Manila—slots fill quickly at peak season (Sept–Dec).
